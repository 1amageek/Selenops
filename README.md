Welcome to **Selenops**, a Swift Web Crawler.

Selenops is a lightweight, Swift-based web crawler that efficiently searches for specific words across web pages. Built with Swift Concurrency, it provides a safe and performant way to crawl websites.

## Features

- ‚ú® Built with Swift Concurrency (async/await)
- üîç Efficient word search across web pages
- üõ°Ô∏è Safe concurrent operations with Actor model
- üéØ Domain-specific crawling
- üìä Progress tracking
- üîå Extensible delegate pattern for data management
- üì± Command-line interface tool included

## Requirements

- Swift 6.0+
- iOS 18.0+
- macOS 15.0+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add Selenops as a dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/1amageek/Selenops.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### Command Line Tool

To install the command-line tool:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `swift build -c release`
3. The binary will be located at `.build/release/selenops-cli`

You can install it globally by copying it to your path:
```bash
sudo cp .build/release/selenops-cli /usr/local/bin/selenops
```

## Usage

### As a Library

```swift
import Selenops

// Create an executor
let executor = Executor(
    startUrl: URL(string: "https://example.com")!,
    wordToSearch: "swift",
    maximumPagesToVisit: 100
)

// Start crawling
await executor.run()
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage
selenops-cli crawl --url https://example.com --word swift --max-pages 100

# Show help
selenops-cli --help
```

### Custom Implementation

You can create your own crawler delegate by conforming to the `CrawlerDelegate` protocol:

```swift
actor CustomCrawlerDelegate: CrawlerDelegate {
    private var visitedPages: Set<URL> = []
    private var pagesToVisit: Set<URL> = []
    
    func crawler(_ crawler: Crawler, shouldVisitUrl url: URL) -> Bool {
        // Your URL filtering logic
        return true
    }
    
    func crawler(_ crawler: Crawler, didFindWordAt url: URL) {
        // Handle found word
        print("Found word at: \(url)")
    }
    
    // Implement other required methods...
}

// Use your custom delegate
let crawler = Crawler(
    startURL: URL(string: "https://example.com")!,
    maximumPagesToVisit: 100,
    wordToSearch: "swift"
)

let delegate = CustomCrawlerDelegate()
await crawler.setDelegate(delegate)
await crawler.start()
```

## Features

### Domain-Specific Crawling

By default, Selenops only crawls URLs within the same domain as the start URL. This behavior can be customized by implementing your own `shouldVisitUrl` logic in the delegate.

### Progress Tracking

Selenops provides detailed progress tracking through its delegate methods:

```swift
func crawler(_ crawler: Crawler, willVisitUrl url: URL) {
    print("Currently visiting: \(url)")
}

func crawlerDidFinish(_ crawler: Crawler) {
    print("Crawling completed")
}
```

### Data Management

The delegate pattern allows for flexible data storage solutions:

- In-memory storage
- Database storage
- Distributed storage
- Custom storage solutions

## Dependencies

- [SwiftSoup](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup) - HTML Parser
- [Swift Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) - Command-line interface support
